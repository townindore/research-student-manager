research-student-manager
========================

A MySQL and PHP based research student manager for managing graduate research students in universities.

This project is about developing a web-based management tool that can be used to manage research students in a university by the administrators. The purpose of developing such a tool is to automate the research student management tasks usually carried out manually by administrative staff of the university. By introducing and implementing this tool, this project aims to improve the automation and the efficiency of the management process.
Through this process, the research student manager has been designed and built with software engineering principles and methodologies. It has realized functionalities including student manager, supervisor information, project management and notifications. Since the focus of administrative work of research student at a university is around managing students, the system in this project reflects just this throughout the design process.
The results of this implementation and the system built hopes to improve the work efficiency of research student management work at the university for the administrators, and bring about automation and innovation in their work process. It would be even more beneficial if the findings from this project can provide implications for other researches and projects.
